# üì± Mobile Fullscreen Feature

## What's New

The game now automatically enters fullscreen mode on mobile devices for an immersive gaming experience!

## Features

### ‚úÖ Auto-Fullscreen on Mobile
- Game automatically enters fullscreen when loaded on mobile devices
- Maximizes screen space for better gameplay
- Hides browser UI for distraction-free experience

### üéÆ Fullscreen Toggle Button
- Visible on mobile devices (top-right corner)
- Tap to toggle between fullscreen and normal view
- Icons:
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Enter fullscreen
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è Exit fullscreen

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Behavior
- Remains in normal window mode
- No fullscreen toggle button (desktop users can use F11)
- Optimized canvas sizing

## How It Works

1. **On Mobile Load:**
   - Game detects mobile device
   - Waits for game to finish loading
   - Automatically requests fullscreen (500ms delay)
   - User may need to interact first (browser security)

2. **Fullscreen Toggle:**
   - Tap the button in top-right corner
   - Or swipe from edge to exit (browser gesture)

3. **Responsive Canvas:**
   - Canvas scales to fill entire screen in fullscreen
   - Maintains aspect ratio
   - Uses `object-fit: contain` for proper scaling

## Implementation Details

### Component Changes (`RaylibGame.tsx`)
```typescript
- Added containerRef for fullscreen API
- Added isFullscreen state
- Added isMobile detection
- Auto-enter fullscreen on mobile after load
- Fullscreen enter/exit functions
- Fullscreen change event listeners
- Fullscreen toggle button (mobile only)
```

### CSS Updates (`RaylibGame.module.css`)
```css
- .fullscreen class for full viewport coverage
- Mobile-specific canvas scaling
- Fullscreen button styling
- Pulsing "Tap to enter fullscreen" hint
```

## Browser Compatibility

‚úÖ **Supported:**
- Chrome/Edge (Android & iOS)
- Safari (iOS)
- Firefox (Android)
- Samsung Internet

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes:**
- iOS Safari requires user interaction before fullscreen
- Some browsers may show fullscreen permission prompt
- Exit via browser gesture still available

## Testing

### On Mobile Device:
1. Open game on mobile: `https://YOUR_IP:3000`
2. Wait for game to load
3. Game should auto-enter fullscreen
4. Tap button to toggle if needed

### Desktop:
1. Open game: `https://localhost:3000`
2. No fullscreen button visible
3. Use F11 for browser fullscreen (optional)

## User Experience

### Before:
- Game in small browser window
- Browser UI visible (address bar, navigation)
- Limited screen space
- Distracting elements

### After:
- üì± Full screen immersion
- üéÆ No UI distractions
- üìê Maximum play area
- ‚ö° Better touch controls (more space)
- üéØ Professional mobile game feel

## Customization

### Disable Auto-Fullscreen
Edit `RaylibGame.tsx`, comment out:
```typescript
// Auto-enter fullscreen on mobile when game loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (isMobile && !loading && !error && canvasRef.current) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      enterFullscreen();
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isMobile, loading, error, enterFullscreen]);
```

### Change Button Position
Edit `RaylibGame.module.css`:
```css
.fullscreenButton {
  top: 10px;    /* Change these */
  right: 10px;  /* values */
}
```

### Change Button Icon
Edit `RaylibGame.tsx`:
```tsx
{isFullscreen ? '‚¨áÔ∏è' : '‚¨ÜÔ∏è'}
// Replace with custom icons or text
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fullscreen Not Working
- **Cause:** Browser requires user interaction
- **Solution:** Tap anywhere on game first, then button

### Button Not Visible
- **Cause:** May be under loading overlay
- **Solution:** Wait for game to fully load

### Canvas Not Scaling
- **Cause:** Browser doesn't support object-fit
- **Solution:** Update to latest browser version

### Exits Fullscreen Immediately
- **Cause:** Browser security policy
- **Solution:** User must initiate fullscreen from gesture

## Device Detection Integration

Works seamlessly with device detection:
- Uses `isMobileDevice()` to detect mobile
- Adjusts UI accordingly
- Combines with muzzle flash scaling
- Part of overall mobile optimization

## Performance

- **No Performance Impact:** Fullscreen is browser native
- **Better Performance:** Less UI rendering in fullscreen
- **Smoother Gameplay:** More GPU resources available
- **Touch Optimization:** Full screen = better touch detection

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Landscape orientation lock
- [ ] Portrait mode warning
- [ ] Fullscreen onboarding tooltip
- [ ] Swipe gestures for fullscreen toggle
- [ ] Custom fullscreen controls overlay

**Result:** Professional mobile gaming experience with one tap! üì±üéÆ‚ú®
